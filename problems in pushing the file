I was not being able to push the file initially
This was because i created a readme.md file in myappsample folder on the github browser
so when i was trying to push the file into this repository, it was not being accepted,
as my local repository did not have the readme.md file. Pushing the file would cause overlapping, so git didn't allow me to push

solution
I integrated my remote changes with the local one.
For this Io followed the following steps:

1)Refresh the tracking branch: git fetch origin master

This command helps to copy the current remote repo to the local repo


2)Rewrite the local changes: git rebase origin/master

This integrates the remote changes with the our changes made in the local repo

3)Try the push again: git push origin master

Now the push operation works successfully. This is because
initially, our changes would have replaced the changes made in the remote repo. 
But now our rewritten local branch does not have that problem:
it includes the remote repo changes exactly in the same places as they are already on the remote branch.
