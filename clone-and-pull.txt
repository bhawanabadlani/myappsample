Further in the video, functions of clone and pull command were explained.
When we want to pull a repository we can either download the zip file
or we can clone the file into a folder by using the command
git clone <link of the repo to be downloaded>
Note: open git bash from the new folder where repo is to be downloaded.

If we want to pull the changes made by other developers, 
then we have to run the pull command from git bash window from the original folder. 
git pull origin master
